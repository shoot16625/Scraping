       "['Consider me \"mind blown\".  I setup the range extender in my house on the 2nd level to support my sons PC, he was having lag issues on minecraft.  I wasn\\'t expecting to much from this item, just hoping to boost the signal in the 1500 square foot house from the main floor to the second floor.  To my surprise not only did the TP-Link boost the signal to the 2nd floor as desired but it also increased my signal strength in the basement on my primary PC.  Now, when I say increased I mean INCREASED!!!!, talking going from 3mbs to 44mbs (download speeds).  This was a huge surprise to me and I am ecstatic about this product.  I would recommend this item to anyone who has a weak signal from their primary router.  Never thought I would get more from a range extender then I do my wireless router.  Great product.  Pictures/video to come confirming speeds.',\n",
       " \"My mother has no idea what wi-fi is. It was terrible going to her house to have no connection. The only connection was to a single desktop computer in the office with the modem. For my own sanity I looked up the cheapest well reviewed router on Amazon and found this one. Set it up super easy and it works just fine for me and my mother who I taught to set up her phone on it.If you do this for your family member I highly recommend labeling all the cables with tape and neon sticky notes so if it gets unplugged they know what goes where. My mother had to rearrange the furniture and move it and she didn't have any trouble plugging it back in where the labels said. I also recommend taping a note to the router saying what the IP and password is as she did forget it a few times but was able to just look at the note I put there.She likes that she can have a password on the wireless as she didn't want people stealing her internet.For $20 you can't beat having access to the internet wirelessly. It has strong signal even on the second floor.No complaints. I haven't had her call me with any issues with it and I installed it 2 years ago. When I come over it is still working.\",\n",
       " \"After I read all reviews I decided to give try to this wifi extender . Was super easy to I install just plugged waif few mins to load go on ur pc to tplinkextender.net login w password Admin /Admin then follow the steps . I located my extender on 2nd floor where my wifi signal were weak and after I'm using it upstairs I don't issues my wifi signal improved to were now I can stream my shows on Netflix and channels and also my wife can work from home and use her laptop work that requires high speed internet connection . I gave this product 5 stars cuz it works .\",\n",
       " 'All I can say is WOW! I live in up in the hills of Kentucky in a Holler so my other houses our not right next door they are a good 1/10 of a mile away at least. My father lives under me and he uses my internet connection on wifi and he does not get a good connection maybe 1-2 bars. So when he got an amazon fire tv which we use for Playstation Vue, Netflix, and Hulu he would be able to watch but it would stop here and there because of the low signal strength. We decided to try this out and see if it would solve the problem and it did not only could I see my modem at full strength but I could see three other modems two of them at full strength and one at 60-80% went up and down. To let you know one house close to me is 1/10 a mile the one that is farthest is 1/4 a mile and at 1/4 a mile I still got a 60-80% signal from them. If you want to extend your range I would recommend this product it is amazing.',\n",
       " \"A great wifi extender that did exactly as it said it would, Expand my network! It's great! I highly recommend it for anyone that has connection problems in certain areas of there home. I'm actually going to buy another now that I think about it lol.\",\n",
       " 'A snap to set up and works great. For dual band, do the simple WPS routine twice. First time pairs 2.4 band and second time pairs the 5.0 band. I like the separate 2.4 and 5.0 indicator lights that let you know they are working and placement is good. Extended my range a couple of rooms and out to the back patio where I can enjoy sitting outside with my tablet.',\n",
       " 'A great product - beautifully packaged, easy to set and works so well to extend my Wi-Fi to other rooms of the house.  Thanks for making such a good product.',\n",
       " 'As my room is the only dead spot in the house, I hated having to use my data on my phone 90% of the time. This really made a difference!',\n",
       " 'After many failed attempts at a DIY range extender with DD-WRT, I decided to pick one of these up. I figured for the price, it would be worth having a \"Wife approved\" solution. This was by far the easiest extender setup I\\'ve ever experienced. I\\'ve become quite a fan of TP-Link. There\\'s really not too much to this thing once you get it setup the first time. After that, it just works. I\\'ve had months of up-time, and by the time you would have a problem, you\\'ve probably power-cycled due to your crappy ISP anyway.I believe there is one model below this one, but I purchased this one because it best matched the specifications of my router, the TP-Link TL-WDR4300.One of my favorite features is the ethernet port on the bottom of the unit. What a brilliant idea. I didn\\'t think I would use it, but now that I have it, I use it constantly. I have this down by my TV connected to a switch to bring Internet to my Blu-Ray, XBox, and MythTV DVR. I highly recommend this product if you\\'re in a situation like mine.',\n",
       " 'After moving our \"standard cable company-provided\" router to the first floor master bedroom of our 4000 sqft two-story house, the kids began to complain about the wireless signal not reaching their second story bedrooms.  I begin reviewing $200-$400 long-range routers, and just before pulling the trigger to buy one, I saw an article promoting the sale price of this little TP-Link AC750 Dual Band WiFi Range Extender.  I figured it was worth a shot.  The product arrived yesterday, was easily set-up in all of about 3 minutes, and then relocated to the second floor.  Both kids ran to their corner rooms on either end of the upstairs and reported back that both our 2.4G and 5G had \"full bars\" in their rooms.  Problem solved - and at about 5-10% of a new router.

I begin reviewing $200-$400 long-range routers, and just before pulling the trigger to buy one, I saw an article promoting the sale price of this little TP-Link AC750 Dual Band WiFi Range Extender.  I figured it was worth a shot.  The product arrived yesterday, was easily set-up in all of about 3 minutes, and then relocated to the second floor.  Both kids ran to their corner rooms on either end of the upstairs and reported back that both our 2.4G and 5G had \"full bars\" in their rooms.  Problem solved - and at about 5-10% of a new router.

I originally had my doubts, but the performance is well above my expectations. My router is a new TP-Link AC3150. I've used several TP-Link products in the past, and I've always been happy with the results. Now, I'm using TP-Link products almost exclusively.

This repeater takes the 2.4 and 5 Ghz signals and boost them up significantly.The set up process was simple and straightforward, and let extend the signal as the original (not an extension or a .2 version of the original as I ow on some youtube videos) thinking that I will have to change the wireless connection or the devices will do it automatically once the source was dropped. As of now, fortunately in my case, my devices will pick up the range extender automatically (doing something called roaming, a complex subject and configuration in case that they weren't picking up the extender).The only complaint is that I was nat able to access the configuration of the extender (web interface) to change the access password from my iphone and I had to use my macbook and safari.

It doesn't extend the current wi-fi network, it creates a new one with the same credentials, so if you are in range of both and move around, you might be on a weak signal.

This product cancelled all of those issues out. Everything connected to the WiFi is at full bars and runs perfectly now. I did a before and after speedtest to see if it was actually speeding up the connection, and it was. I was easily getting 50/50 when before I was barely getting around 20/20. I know, first world problems. Setting up the device was as easy as plugging it into the wall and going to the website given to set up the WiFi. It took no more than 5 minutes. Right away I noticed everything had a stronger connection and never dropped its WiFi signal. Even the master bathroom that has never been able to have much of a connection ever had just about full bars. This thing is wonderful and I'm so glad I bought it. I'd recommend it to everyone.

I had no WiFi in my apartment and didn\\'t miss it until I bought a new \"Smart TV\" with WiFi capability.  So I ordered this very affordable WiFi router from amazon.com and it works like a charm.  It was very easy to install between my existing AT&T DSL modem by Motorola and came with the extra ethernet cable necessary to do that.  I was out of space to set it on any surface near the computer, but was delighted to find it had two keyhole-shaped holes on the bottom so I was able to hand it on two removable plastic hooks on the wall behind my desktop computer tower, so that worked like a charm.  Though it came with software on a mini-CD-ROM, Windows 7 recognized the router on its own and set up the network for me -- all I had to do was change the complex password Windows 7 assigned to one I can remember.  The \"Quick Set-Up Guide\" made hooking the router up very easy -- there\\'s really nothing to it -- and also directed me to a webpage that showed all the date for the new WiFi network and allowed me to rename my new WiFi network to something I can recognize when it shows up as a choice of WiFi networks on a device like my Kindle 3 or my new TV, not to mention the ability to come up with a new security password (again, one I can remember since the native password is too random and complex) to keep intruders from accessing my WiFi.  I wondered if the speed of this router would be fast enough, but it totally is.  I can now used my \"Smart TV\" to watch videos, listen to audio (music) files, and view photos resident on my computer and the videos run and display without pauses for buffering.  Further, my TV is now hooked up directly to the Internet and if I want to join one of the video streaming services to watch a movie on my HDTV, now I can.  No need to wait for a used DVD rental to show up in the mail or to send it back in the return mailer.  By the way, in the box were the router, the power cord with a small \"brick\" plug with two prongs to go into a 120-volt wall outlet or a surge protector, the mini-CD-ROM, a short ethernet cable to connect your existing modem to the router, and paperwork including an instruction booklet and that useful \"Quick Set-Up Guide\" on a single sheet of paper.

That was 6 months ago, almost to the day.  The second one is doing the same thing that the first one did.  I just shuts off and I have to reset it.  The problem is this router is at my mother in laws house and it runs her Vonage phone.  No router,,, NO phone.  She is 93 and has cancer.  She must have a phone so the quickest thing that I could do is order another and get a refund.  WELLLL, TP-Link has washed their hands of me and wants me to go through Amazon.  Fine,,, but there is no way to return something that was sent to me without payment.

I tested it and seems to help where I was not getting as much buffering. The signals to my computers and Bluetooth upstairs and smart TV seems to increase a little. However, a few days later in watching an Internet TV show the same thing happened. Freeze of the video and buffering for a long time. That's when I realize that the range of this repeater is not strong enough and I should have bought a more expensive product.

       " \"Seems to be working well for its intended purposes. One thing I didn't realize immediately was that do to the nature of how extenders operate, they run at 50% of whatever your good signal regular wifi gets.  So our internet is 60mbps, so the extended network pulls as perfectly solid 30mbps down connection. For the user on the extended network this is totally fine and perfectly fast for all kinds of tasks so works great here.Extender is basically at one end of the house and the router is at the other, both on the same wall, on the same floor, and with direct line of sight. Intended user is on the floor above, and then on the exact opposite wall parallel to these devices. Signal is excellent! No issues at all, I found the setup very easy and away we go.Without the extender we were getting 2-5mbps down with very low signal, and bad consistency in speed. With maybe occasional spikes to 15 mbps.With the extender, as mentioned its a solid 30mbps with perfect signal. Given our internet speeds the extender is operation 100% perfectly.All for a super low reasonabele price. Very happy so far~\",\n",

Ended up using Verizon's own services and equipment to solve our connectivity issues. Tried to return the device to TP-Link but they refused since we were two weeks past deadline. Would only offer a replacement. No thanks. Will take business elsewhere and I would recommend others do the same.\",\n",
       " \"TP-LINK has always been my go-to for tech products because it is an affordable but great quality brand. I have previously bought the TP-LINK RE850 and it has so far been a great experience. This time, I wanted to have a dual band extender and this was just the perfect item I've been contemplating about. I love the fact that it is dual band (2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz). The design and shape is modern and does not need hiding unlike other extenders. It is budget-friendly and has the power of well-known brands as well. Extremely easy to setup -- in under 3 minutes I was able to do so. Follow the instructions and you should be fine.My home signal is extremely great and covers the entire perimeter of my house. Awesome as ever!\",\n",
       " \"For under $30, this product offers a solid extension of your 2.4GHz wifi connection. But if you're looking to extend your wifi, you're probably the type of consumer that also has a 5GHz capable router, or a house large enough that it could use one. While it worked sometimes, it would often drop the 5GHz connection and/or completely disable it, even for users who were right next to the actual router. I would unplug the extender and then people would immediately be able to log back into the 5GHz line, so it was clearly the extender's issue. Other than that, the experience was adequate. The setup was easy, although somewhat of a hassle in my opinion. Having to plug it in next to the router, and then move to a slightly farther outlet, redo the process, and then keep doing that until I was where I wanted the extender to be long term was cumbersome and took several tries for the extender to reliably connect. The product itself is designed well. A solid plastic build that's unassuming while plugged in. It looks like a febreeze freshener (and I mean that in the best way possible). The lights provide solid feedback on how well the extender is functioning, even if the product itself was not consistent. Overall, an acceptable product for the price, but it does not fully deliver on its advertised feature set, specifically on the features that I need for my individual needs.\",\n",
       " 'Somewhat disappointed with this product, but it\\'s ok for the price. Initially this did not work even after following the setup instructions from TP-Link\\'s website.  I eventually went back to their website to update the firmware, and then it finally connected as intended.  Once I got it working, the actual performance was not stellar like the other reviews here.  The signal strength as reported by the [tplinkrepeater.net] website was not so strong if this extender was placed more than 10-15 feet away from the \"main router\". I was getting fairly good signal strengths (both green lights on the 2.4 and 5G bands) but only when this was placed 1 room away from the main router (with only a single wall separating the rooms). I live in a home where the walls are typical plasterboards rather than thick wood or cement foundations.  So I can\\'t imagine why the signal strength would be dampened so much when this extender is placed more than 1 (adjacent) room away.  A small caveat for those using Apple Airport routers (e.g. Airport Extreme) as your main router, be aware that this \"extender\" will not appear as a separate device icon in your Apple Airport Utility app.  Instead, on the Airport Utility connection layout you will only notice that it\\'s active and \"connected\" when you click on your main router\\'s icon, and then see this extender listed as one of the wireless clients connected to your router, and this extender is listed under its SSID like C4E9843BC1xxxx etc.  In the end, the price is reasonably low enough that it works for my intended purpose.',\n",
       " 'Just received this Home Router with the ARRIS / Motorola SB6121 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem and it took no time at all to hook everything up, sync with cable company and enjoy faster speeds than I was seeing before.The problem started when an aging DOCSIS 2.0 modem/router combo kept dropping internet connection randomly and frequently.  Speeds used to be reasonable at 20 Mbps download and 10 Mbps Upload but then after the cable company activated some new cable boxes by sending a signal to the home the problem began and speeds (when working) dropped down to 7 Mbps down and 7 Mbps up.  I had attached a separate older router to the modem/router combo which did increase speed but with the constant dropping of internet this was not the solution.I have a Linksys WRT54G2 router that I bought a few years ago and it worked great but now with newer technology and higher demand for wireless this router is not adequate enough for what I need.  Signal started to be a  problem with this router as it lacks external antennae but when I lived in a 1 bedroom apartment it was fine.I saw the TP-Link TL-WR841N Wireless N300 Home Router was not only more than what I needed but highly liked and reviewed as well as extremely reasonable in price.  My old router still costs 3 times as much as this router does.  Set-up was super simple.  The signal was recognized by my phone, I connected to the network using the password printed on the bottom of the router and went to the set-up page that the quick install directions had instructed me to do.  The quick install was very quick without needing any software.  Like I said I set up the wireless network from my smart phone.  You just have to set an SSID, put in a new password, and save everything and your done.  The process was less than 5 minutes including opening the package and plugging everything in.Signal strength was the first thing I noticed as being strong to very strong even two stories above the router which is in the basement.  The second thing I noticed was speed.  I did not run this router with the older modem so I can not say that it is faster in comparison but the top speed is 300 Mbps which I do not subscribe to but I was getting 40+Mbps download (50 Mbps subscription) and about 15 Mbps upload. This is more than enough to play on XBOX live and stream HD videos to multiple devices without hesitation.  I am very happy with this product.***UPDATE***After 2 months of use I am still happy with this product.  I still regularly see speeds in the 40+ Mbps for download but I average about 35 Mbps, and I see speeds up to 15 Mbps for uploads but average about 13 Mbps.  I use the OOKLA app on my Samsung GS4 more often then my other devices, and I am quoting my average and top speeds based on that device but I will note that my iPad and my Mac Mini see slightly higher speeds as I believe the wifi radio is better in those devices.  I do see better results also when I am above the wireless router (located in the basement) then when I am at the perimeter of the house.  This is actually great news for me as I was worried about the signal not being able to penetrate through 2 floors and remain strong but I see better speed test results in my bedroom (2nd floor) where my Mac Mini, Xbox reside then in the living room  (1st floor)where my iPad and GS4 usually are at.More often with my phone lately I am having problems with my wifi dropping because it is telling me that an authentication error occurred.  I merely just reselect my home wifi from the list and it connects but then randomly it will give me that error.  I looked into it and it appears GS4 phones have this problem but mine just started doing this.  I will reset the router and my phone and see if that solves the problem which is a common solution.  Other than this small issues, which sounds like my phones problem, I really like this router.  For the price it is hard to beat.',\n",

Yes, $19.99!Update: 2/26/2016This router has been up non-stop for weeks now. Still no issues and running like a champ!

It was a little tricky at first, but after a few reboots it pulled an IP address and has been up for several hours now. I logged in fine and was able to configure the device to my liking. There are a few negative reviews regarding longevity. My router that just died was installed almost 5 years ago. I would hope to get at least that out of it. If not, I probably won't be to disappointed as I only paid around $20 bucks for it 13 months ago. I have an iPad mini, 2 iPhones, 2 Kindles, a laptop, Blue Ray Disc, Fire TV, IP phone, and a smart tv hooked up to it. So far, so good. I will try to give an update soon.\",\n",

At first the router was great and worked perfectly and then all of a sudden it started constantly generating some strange errors over and over. The network started just disconnecting all of the devices that were associated with it, wouldn't let me access the router even from a wired connection and would just stop working all together. A reboot fixes this issues however it has been driving me crazy as it has happened over 4-8 times a day in the past 2 weeks. I'm literally in the middle of conference calls and get dropped because my router dies, or watching a movie that freezes because my router dies. This product has become a huge point of failure for my network and TP-Link has not helped.My first contact with customer service I was told there were no issues they are aware of and that if I simply restore the router to factory defaults it would work, that solution failed.My second contact with customer support I was told that this actually is a documented acknowledged issue but that R&D just released a beta firmware that resolves the issue, that update didn't help.My third contact I have email TP-Link again asking for help but at this point am going to try and return this router because I am so frustrated and disappointed by it's performance and mediocre support from the manufacturer for a serious issue.If I could give this router less than 1 star I would\",\n",
       " \"I was obviously looking to extend my ISP provided Wi-Fi signal to help with some outdoor security cameras I installed.  The extender is on the main floor of my home about 20' away from my router.Pros: very simply to setup. It helps my Wi-Fi to reach the exterior camera that was struggling to detect my router.Cons: doesn't recover from a power blip well. Has to be unplugged/plugged back in and of course only when you notice.  Another exterior camera that is roughly 20' away with nearly line of sight, isn't able to detect a strong signal so the range of the extender seems pretty limited which is an obvious bummer considering its purpose.Overall, I was able to accomplish my purpose but based on other reviews, was hoping for a much stronger signal at greater distances.  Would recommend if trying to extend a signal in an open space but am skeptical it would function well through multiple walls/floors of a home.\",\n",

       " \"I've had this for 9 months and just ordered a refurbished Netgear R4500 for a great price (likely since I'll probably need to restore its firmware to get it to work).  The reason I was looking to upgrade is not that the TL-WR841N stopped working, but that we've added 2 HD IP cameras to our network which appear to be over-taxing the router and/or the 2.4Ghz band.  I'm not certain of this, but we've had a lot of lag and I think there's just too much for this inexpensive router to handle.  That said, it continues to work for everything else.This is a basic router that does what you'd expect for the price.  It doesn't have the greatest range or speed (we live in a 1600sf 2-story condo and get signal everywhere, though with the router upstairs, devices downstairs only get about 8Mbps on speedtest.net compared with around 20Mbps on a wired connection).  It doesn't have any fancy features like dual bands or guest network, but it has a decent web interface that gives you the essentials (static IPs, security, etc.).  For smallish houses that just want to browse the web or stream Netflix, it works well.  If you're doing a lot of file transfers across your local network, have a large house or suspect you're getting a lot of interference on the 2.4Ghz band, you probably want to step up to a dual band router with at least an N600 rating (and gigabit ethernet if you will be transferring between wired computers).  A guest network can be a nice feature to look out for, too, as it allows you to give a different wifi password to guests and prevent them from seeing computers on your private network.  The ability to plug in an external hard drive to USB for network file sharing independent of a computer can be handy too.  This router doesn't have these features, so if those are important to you, look elsewhere.\",\n",
       " 'Very useful and fast. The default configuration and placement I used initially did not help as much as I would have liked but thanks to the options for splitting the bands 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands and some playing around with the location, I now get the speed on mobile devices I am paying my ISP for. The only issue that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that the advanced options instructions were a little confusing even for a nerd so it may take some trial and error.NOTE: I use an Apple Airport as my main WiFi router and this worked perfectly with it and had no issues. If you are somewhat technically included, just follow the directions to fill in the \"dark\" spots in your WiFi coverage. Excellent price for what it has done for our household.',\n",

Both of these units need great Wi-Fi speed to bring you the clearest picture possible. And this unit was just the trick. It works fantastic! I have never had a problem with it. My streams are flawless. It has his work cut out for it since we have about 10 devices in the room for it to magnify the signal. But it does it beautifully with its dual capacity. The indicator lights give you an idea on how well the unit is operating. It syncs up with your router with just a press of a button. Once all the indicator lights have litten up then the extender is ready for relocation. Once you get to your location just simply plug it in and it does the rest.
